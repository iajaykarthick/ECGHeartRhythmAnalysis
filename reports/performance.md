# Comparative Performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest Models on ECG Data


## Atrial Fibrillation (Class 0)
- **Logistic Regression AUC**: 0.95
- **SVM AUC**: 0.92
- **Random Forest AUC**: 0.97
  - **Observation**: Random Forest outperforms both Logistic Regression and SVM for Atrial Fibrillation, with the highest AUC indicating superior sensitivity and specificity.

## Normal Rhythms (Class 1)
- **Logistic Regression AUC**: 0.78
- **SVM AUC**: 0.85
- **Random Forest AUC**: 0.87
  - **Observation**: Random Forest also leads in identifying Normal Rhythms, followed closely by SVM and with Logistic Regression lagging behind.

## Other Rhythms (Class 2)
- **Logistic Regression AUC**: 0.71
- **SVM AUC**: 0.78
- **Random Forest AUC**: 0.81
  - **Observation**: All models show room for improvement in classifying Other Rhythms, but Random Forest holds a slight edge over SVM and a more notable advantage over Logistic Regression.

## Noise (Class 3)
- **Logistic Regression AUC**: 0.90
- **SVM AUC**: 0.71
- **Random Forest AUC**: 0.91
  - **Observation**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest are comparable and excel in identifying Noise, with SVM performing less effectively for this class.

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model generally provides the best performance across all classes, especially for Atrial Fibrillation and Noise, where it either exceeds or matches the Logistic Regression model's performance. SVM, while superior to Logistic Regression for Normal Rhythms, falls short in Noise classification. Therefore, the choice of model should be informed by the specific requirements of sensitivity and specificity for each rhythm class.
