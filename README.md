# ECG Heart Rhythm Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for classifying heart rhythms using electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The main focus is on identifying Atrial Fibrillation (AF), normal rhythm, other arrhythmias, and noisy recordings.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises single-lead ECG recordings, provided in MATLAB V4 WFDB-compliant format, including `.mat` files for the ECG data and `.hea` files for waveform information.

## Objective
- To implement and evaluate different machine learning models for ECG signal classification.
- To explore feature engineering techniques for extracting informative attributes from ECG data.
- To contribute to the automated analysis of ECG data, aiding in the early detection of cardiac anomalies.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and preprocess ECG signals.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implement methods to extract meaningful features from ECG data.
- **Model Development**: Develop and train machine learning models for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
